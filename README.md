# News_Classification_LR_TFIDF_NB_BoW

link dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset

This project focuses on topic classification using a labeled text dataset. It is implemented with the scikit-learn library and explores two different modeling approaches:

Bag-of-Words (BoW) combined with Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)

TF-IDF combined with Logistic Regression

The purpose of applying both algorithms is to compare their performance and evaluate the strengths of each method. This comparison serves as part of an academic requirement for a course project at the university.
